the parts i will need
- charts that I used
- different architectures and action modeling strategies
    - compare to generic log-prob minimization
- include a chart with method name, parameter used, and final reward

steps
- first i think im going to open the files and make sure i can process them
- i want to set up a pipeline that i can modify to try different architecutres and action models
- then research into these different methods
